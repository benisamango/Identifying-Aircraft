                If you live in Brisbane or have been outside while on campus at UQ, odds are that you have seen an aircraft fly overhead.
                Brisbane airport is a close 23km from UQ where around 700 aircraft take-off and land every day.
                I had never noticed it at first, however if you pay attention to which aircraft come in, you begin to notice the different aircraft types and even the schedule of their arrivals.
                Having become interested in the world of aviation, I have wanted to create a website for anyone who may also be interested in the types of aircraft that fly into Brisbane every day.
                The website will be a simple guide for identifying the aircraft that land at Brisbane airport. This website provides a list of six commercial aircraft that commonly land at
                Brisbane Airport and focuses on two main distinctions used to identify aircraft: aircraft engines and aircraft tails.
